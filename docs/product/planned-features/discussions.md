# Discussions

#### Discussions [`⇧`](https://github.com/activist-org/activist?tab=readme-ov-file#contents)



> Dedicated forums for organizations and their events.

Discussions will also allow organizations, groups and events to send notifications to supporters. Included features for democratic decision making will further enable asynchronous planning.

#### Better discussions, better decisions

Our encrypted chats are great, but sometimes discussions need a different format.

Voting in your general assembly on a decision is great, but many democratic decisions should not have to wait until the next meeting.

Our discussion threads will enable groups to communicate, discuss and decide asynchronously, democratically and with a high degree of inclusion.

#### Dedicated forums

Every organization, group and event will have a dedicated forum functionality. So you can stay on topic with the people it concerns. Upvote good takes, mark the bad input.

#### Get valuable perspectives

Give different types of personalities the opportunity to be heard – not just the loud ones.

Every member of an organization, group or event can join in a discussion whenever they have time. Our product also adheres to the highest technical accessibility standards to assure ease of use.

We’re also building a translation team that can support in breaking down language barriers.

#### Vote on decisions

Make collective decisions by allocating votes that express the _degree_ of your preferences, not just _direction_.

#### Decide async

You don’t want to have to wait until the next meeting to address an issue?

Asynchronous. Democratic. Informed. Accessible/Inclusive.
