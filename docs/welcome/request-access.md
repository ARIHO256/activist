Our aim is to secure a progressive community by design – putting platform health before platform growth.

## Community Governance

We aim to create a self-governing platform where community-driven processes ensure inclusivity and accountability, without imposing rigid top-down guidelines. Rather than acting as a centralized authority, we aim to empower organizations to maintain collective oversight. Any organization can apply to join the platform, and acceptance is determined by peer sponsorship—if three existing organizations sponsor a new applicant, they are accepted.

To maintain a balance of accountability, if an organization is flagged, the flaggers provide reasons for banning. A voting process is triggered if a certain threshold of flags is reached, involving the entire network. The majority vote determines whether the organization remains on the platform or is banned. This decentralized decision-making process puts the community in control.

Organizations that sponsor a banned organization will receive a strike, and after three strikes, they lose the ability to sponsor new organizations.&#x20;

This system encourages careful sponsorship while preventing misuse of platform governance.

## Request access

Together with experienced activists we are selecting an initial group of organizations that have a proven track record of inclusivity and elevating underrepresented groups. We are still developing our operating principles and will always update them based on community decisions. Questions around flagging, banning, guidelines and rules will always be answered collectively.
