# Circles and Groups

The activist community is creating a digital global platform where people get active, organized and movements grow. We are building infrastructure that is free to use, open-source, privacy-focused and governed by its users. We want to rival commercial campaigning tools that are often inaccessible — financially and/or technically — for small progressive organizations, especially when they grow. Activists therefore often resort to using BigTech platforms, which are in many cases diametrically opposed to their goals.

We need to end this dependence and put tools for action into the hands of everyone willing to work towards a more equitable society. That also means building a user experience that is easy and fun to use while establishing security best-practices from the very beginning. Well-executed campaign tactics should not be the exception for well-funded and/or tech-savvy activists.

Let’s update how power is distributed in our society by removing barriers and enabling more people to safely engage in a political life.

You want to contribute? Amazing! Join our organization and support in the best way you can.
